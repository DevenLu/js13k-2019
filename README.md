It's year 2413, humanity is enslaved by an alien race since centuries.
You are an AI weaponized virus built to infiltrate the main core of the alien civilization and deactivate all power generators and weapon systems.

The alien antivirus will detect and delete you after 13 seconds.

But remember: a file is never really deleted. Use the execution trace from your previous attempts to break in and destroy the main memory core.
